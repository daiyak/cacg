## Overview

The Cybernetic Avatar is a concept of a networked embodiment that digitally extends and transmits human physical, perceptual, and cognitive capabilities through the Internet.

It envisions a world where people can project their presence, perception, and action beyond the limits of body, space, and time by connecting to digital or robotic embodiments.
This breakout session will share the current vision and motivation behind the emerging Cybernetic Avatar Community Group (currently in formation).

We aim to discuss how the concept of the Cybernetic Avatar could relate to existing or future Web standards, and how the W3C community might help define its role within the broader Internet ecosystem.
Together, we will consider how human embodiment, communication, and agency may evolve through connected systems, and how open, ethical, and inclusive frameworks could support this transformation.

We are currently in the process of forming the Cybernetic Avatar Community Group, and this session serves as an open discussion for anyone interested — please join us!
